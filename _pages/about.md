I am a Computer Science undergraduate at UCLA. I work on multimodal and agentic AI, mostly around a question that keeps resurfacing for me: what should a system do when it realizes it might be wrong?

I have done research in UCLA’s StarAI and NLP groups, where I was advised by Guy Van den Broeck, Ying-Nian Wu, and Kai-Wei Chang. My work has focused on structured reasoning, grounding, and understanding when language models drift or hallucinate, especially in settings where those failures carry real consequences.

Alongside this, I am interested in creative applications of AI, including art, animation, and interactive systems that respond to human intent. Teaching is also a constant in my work. Through exploretech.la, I work with high school students encountering machine learning for the first time, and I have learned that ideas only stick when they survive real examples and honest questions. I want to build AI systems that do not just sound confident, but know when to slow down and revise their beliefs.
